# Conlang-Suite-Capstone

## Goal

We want to create a software to organize the language creation process. Ideally, the software will allow a conlanger to build dictionaries, create sound changes, and store information all in one cloud-scalable application.

Some of the main functions our application will include to address disorganization in the conlanging process:

-A desktop program (ideally Mac-compatible) that allows for the storing and creation of a language.

-A “database” storage system, where all material is stored in some recognizable format (be it csv or a MySQL-style database). Something that can be used by some other software down the line, unlike FileMakerPro (an early conlang-style suite was built in FMP, and it produces files that only FMP can use, which rendered all of it ultimately useless).

-Ability to print reports in various formats (.pdf, .doc, .txt, etc.) from the database, and to modify those reports. (For example: We sometimes put together lists of common phrases for actors and production. It’d be nice to call up that list with the press of a button and have it print to a .pdf in a way that looks nice.)

-Ability to create custom dictionary entries.
